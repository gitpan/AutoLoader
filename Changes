Revision history for Perl extension AutoLoader

5.62  Mon Jan 15 15:13 2007
  - First release to CPAN. Previously available in core perl.
  - Fixes an obscure bug in 5.61/5.60 which would result in infinite
    recursion if a module's %INC element is changed to a different
    file name and AutoLoader's AUTOLOAD is used by the module.
    (This can happen with PAR.)
